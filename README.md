# Life-Expectancy-GDP
This project, supported by Codecademy, exhibits my proficiency in the fundamentals of data visualization in Python. I wanted to showcase my understanding of the library add-ons and its Python commands.
# Conclusion
Time and life expectancy has a positive correlation for each country.
The higher a country's GDP, the better its life expectancy improves.
